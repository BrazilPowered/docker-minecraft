Simple project to make a simple baseline forge server for minecraft
run with port 25565 exposed and one of these options:

1) Add your world to a docker volume (located at ${PWD}), and attach it to your world
  docker volume create --driver local -o o=bind -o type=none -o device="${PWD}" mcworld

  docker container run -itp 25565:25565 --rm --name mc -v mcworld:/minecraft/world brazil/minecraft:1.15.2-forge

2) No-pain fresh start with a new random world:
  docker container run -dp 25565:25565 --rm --name mc brazil/minecraft:$ver


Included files are:
README.txt        - This document, to inform
Dockerfile        - used to build the docker image
server.properties - configure forge server in a docker image build for its initial startup; avoid warnings & allow customization
./config/*        - configure forge config in a docker image build
./world/*         - these files should all be copied into any world directory you will use with this image; or sets configurations in advance for your new world


TODO:
server config makes the map ALWAYS start with the "Brazil" seed. Remove that config!

NOTE:
The following Warnings may pop up on start; these typically are only if NO WORLD VOLUME is attached when starting the container (option 2 above)
